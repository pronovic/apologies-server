[Apologies Server](https://github.com/pronovic/apologies-server) is a [Websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) server interface used to interactively play a multi-player game using the [Apologies](https://github.com/pronovic/apologies) library.  The Apologies library implements a game similar to the [Sorry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)) board game.  

It was written as a learning exercise and technology demonstration effort, and serves as a complete example of how to manage a modern (circa 2020) Python project, including style checks, code formatting, integration with IntelliJ, [CI builds at GitHub](https://github.com/pronovic/apologies-server/actions), and integration with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/apologiesserver/) and [Read the Docs](https://apologies-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  

See the [documentation](https://apologies-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/design.html) for notes about the public interface and the event model.
