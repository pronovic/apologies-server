"""
Definition of the public interface for the server.

Both requests (message sent from a client to the server) and events (published 
from the server to one or more clients) can be serialized and deserialized to 
and from JSON.  However, we apply much tighter validation rules on the context
associated with requests, since the input is untrusted.  We assume that the
Python type validations imposed by MyPy give us everything we need for events
that are only built internally.

The file notes/API.md includes a detailed discussion of each request and event.
